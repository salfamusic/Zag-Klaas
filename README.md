# Some questions/comments for Klaas about the mixing and mastering job for my song Zag

Klaas, I felt it was easiest to write out my questions and comments about my song Zag here. Before we jump into the questions I just want to say that I'll make sure I don't make the mistakes I made in sending you the stems for the last song.

## 1. How would you like me to handle a mono synth I have manually widened?
